1. Create a new directory in `~` called `wbthemes`
2. On that directory put your configs in, separated by folder
3. Open the app and change the theme
4. uhhh i think that's it...

###How to convert your current config into a usable one

1. If you haven't done it yet, create a dir in `~` and name it `wbthemes`
2. Make a new dir inside `~/wbthemes` with the name of your theme
3. Done no conf file necessary

if you want you can download a precompiled binary and put it into `/usr/bin/`
